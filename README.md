Computer (AI) Design:

//on first move take one of the two best optimal starting points

//pioritize going for a win over defense

//if win not possible go for a block

//if their is nothing to block check for the common human corner strategy and if so respond accordingly

//else move on first open spot




Goals for Improvement:

//next version should be deployed on heroku 

//recursive minimax function was part of the original design structure; however, implementation did not work as expected

//figure out how to implement minimax without causing the stack to run out of space

//clean up code
