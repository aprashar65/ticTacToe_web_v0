Computer (AI) Design:

//On first move take one of the two best optimal starting points

//Prioritize going for a win over defense

//If win not possible go for a block

//If their is nothing to block check for the common human corner strategy and if so respond accordingly

//Else move on first open spot

Goals for Improvement:

//Next version should be deployed on heroku 

//Recursive minimax function was part of the original design structure; however, implementation did not work as expected

//Figure out how to implement minimax without causing the stack to run out of space

//All in all if you clean up the code the strategy for attack is pretty good no bugs so far. Advantage of this strategy is it uses less resources then recursion and with the same outcome.
